create a state machine for the player
switch statement that checks for each state, and performs
code based on the state.

structs (scriptable objects) with attack data

split hitboxes into two
"hurtbox" (takes damage) 
"hitbox" (deals damage), i.e, create a hitbox when attacking

- ON HIT:
pause game for a moment to allow players to react to what just happened (called hitstop)
during hitstop, players can buffer their next input to allow to it execute on the first possible frame.

combos deal less and less damage the longer it is, else players would get destroyed
