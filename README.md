A 3D, toon-styled Fighting Game inspired by Guilty Gear Strive made in Unity at LBS Kreativa Gymnasiet Gothenburg, Sweden.

This project was developed with the LBS Game Awards in mind, where students strive to create the very best game possible to compete against 30 other schools throughout Sweden.
Each school nominates up to four games that will compete at LBS Game Awards in a multitude of categories. A few categories are as follows: 
- Best 3D Graphics
- Best Technical Implementation
- Best Video Game
